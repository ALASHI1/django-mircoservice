## ‚öôÔ∏è Infrastructure (Terraform)

### S3 Backend Setup
- Stores Terraform state in versioned S3 bucket

### EC2 Deployment
- Amazon Linux 2023 (ARM)
- Docker, Docker Compose installed via GitHub Actions
- Security group exposes ports: 22 (SSH), 80, 443, 8000
- CloudWatch + IAM Role for logs

Run Terraform:
```bash
terraform init
terraform apply
```

## ü§ñ CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
- Deploys to EC2 on every push to `main`
- Uses `appleboy/ssh-action` to SSH and redeploy Docker containers
